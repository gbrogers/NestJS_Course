are we using api models instead of dtos?

The ValidationPipe provides a convenient way of enforcing validation rules for all incoming client payloads. You can specify these rules by using simple annotations in your DTO!

PartialType from nestjs/mapped-types: takes in a class and makes a new class with all the same properties, but all the properties as optional. Inherits all the validator rules as decorators, and add new IsOptional decorator to each.

app.useGlobalPipes(new ValidationPipe({ whitelist: true })); Avoid user passing in invalid properties to creat post request - invalid properties stripped out. Whitelist feature.

/_ Enabling "whitelist" feature of ValidationPipe _/
app.useGlobalPipes(new ValidationPipe({
whitelist: true, // ðŸ‘ˆ
}));

/_ Throw errors when whitelisted properties are found _/
app.useGlobalPipes(new ValidationPipe({
forbidNonWhitelisted: true, // ðŸ‘ˆ
whitelist: true,
}));

// Enabling auto transform feature of ValidationPipe
app.useGlobalPipes(
new ValidationPipe({
transform: true, // ðŸ‘ˆ
}),
);
^^ This will try to transform primitive types (ie. string to number). Allows you to have a number as a parameter type.

By default every path parameter and query parameter come over the network as a string

Providers(aka services) are used to:

1. inject dependencies
2. Handle business logic. Vs doing it in the controller
3. responsible for data storage and retrieval

Modules are recommended best practice for:

1. organize application components
2. encapsulate a closely related set of capabilities
3. determine what is privately and publically available outside of itself

DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):

1. Interfaces for Inputs and Outputs within our system
2. An object used to encapsulate data and send it from one application to another

With NestJS CLI, use --dry-run flag at the end of command to see output that will happen without actually creating anything
